# ROT1-13Encryption
- Easy and accessible ROT 1-13 encoder.
- DO NOT USE FOR SERIOUS ENCRYPTION, ROT IS NOT SAFE FOR ACTUAL ENCRYPTION OF DATA. Use AES, RSA or ECC (or any complex cipher like Vigen√®re Cipher)
- Useful to crypt in game radio systems or general communication systems (GCS).

## Might add comments later on.
