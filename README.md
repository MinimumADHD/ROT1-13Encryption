# WARNINGS:

Here are some things that are worth noting:
* The .exe file is compiled in [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) with some excessive dependency even tho it's not being used.
* Since [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) gives source C/C++, your laptop/pc antivirus might identify it as a virus. [See here for more info](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/229576/program-compiled-with-mingw32-is-reported-as-infected)
* If you see anyone telling you MinGW is a virus (like the image below) just ignore them, those are simply NPC's
